# Cultify

This repository contains the code and resources for the Cultify Project. The idea is to make a platform available for the farmers of India to sell their crops directly, gain knowledge about various mordern farming methodologies as well as rent heavy and expensive tools as well as machineries.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following components:

- **Backend**: Contains the ML model for recommendation of crops to be grown as per the data provided about the soil quality, humidity, pH levels, etc.
- **Frontend**: Includes the frontend code for user interface for the customers to learn about the facilities and contact us as per their needs.
- **Data**: Stores the datasets and CSV files regarding the soil across all over India via which our model recommends the crop to be grown.
